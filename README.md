The FAB features a label ("+") and triggers a basic action (printing to the console) when pressed.

AppBar: A standard Flutter app bar with a centered title ("hello").

Body Content: The main body of the app contains a centered text widget displaying "Hola."

Floating Action Button (FAB): A customizable FAB with a label ("+") and a defined action (printing a message) on press.
